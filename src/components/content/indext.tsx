        Peace of mind about paying for care comes from being prepared for
        tomorrow while enjoying today. But how would you know where to start?...
        Reach out to us! <br /> <br /> Our agency explains your options,
        simplifies your choices, and guides you to the most appropriate and
        affordable plan to help you pay for Long Term Care. Get clarity and
        understanding about your choices! <br /> <br /> After decades of
        advising clients about investments, I turned my focus to Long Term Care
        guidance. I am a Certified Financial Planner, a Juris Doctor, and a
        Registered Investment Adviser with decades of experience. <br /> <br />{" "}
        Most of my clients are people like me – hard working professionals who
        are used to taking care of themselves and are proud of it. I help them
        navigate the somewhat unknown field of Long-Term Care planning. I am
        also an avid gardener, a Jeopardy fan, and an amateur gourmet cook. But,
        most of all, I enjoy the California sunshine and love to bring joy to
        people. Let’s have a conversation!
